1. Create a ZIP file of your `college_practical_helper` folder
2. In PythonAnywhere, go to "Files" tab
3. Upload the ZIP file
4. Extract it to your home directory

**Option B: Manual Upload**
1. In PythonAnywhere, go to "Files" tab
2. Create folder: `college_practical_helper`
3. Upload each file individually

### Step 2: Create Web App

2. Click "Add a new web app"
3. Choose your domain: `yourusername.pythonanywhere.com`
4. Select "Manual configuration"
5. Choose "Python 3.9"

### Step 3: Configure WSGI
1. Click on WSGI configuration file link
2. Replace all content with:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3.9

import sys
import os

# Add your project directory to Python path
sys.path.insert(0, '/home/YOURUSERNAME/college_practical_helper')

from app import app as application

if __name__ == "__main__":
    application.run()
```
**IMPORTANT**: Replace `YOURUSERNAME` with your actual PythonAnywhere username!

### Step 4: Set Up Static Files
1. In Web tab, find "Static files" section
2. Add new mapping:
   - URL: `/static/`
   - Directory: `/home/YOURUSERNAME/college_practical_helper/static/`

### Step 5: Install Dependencies
1. Open a Bash console from "Tasks" ‚Üí "Consoles"
2. Run these commands:
```bash
cd ~/college_practical_helper
pip3.9 install --user flask
python3.9 app.py
```
3. Press Ctrl+C to stop after database is created

### Step 6: Launch Your Website
1. Go back to Web tab
2. Click the big green "Reload" button
3. Visit your URL: `https://yourusername.pythonanywhere.com`

## üéâ Your Website URLs

After deployment, you'll have:
- **Student Access**: `https://yourusername.pythonanywhere.com`
- **Admin Panel**: `https://yourusername.pythonanywhere.com/admin`
- **Debug Helper**: `https://yourusername.pythonanywhere.com/debug-helper`

## üîß Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediate Security Tasks
1. Visit `https://yourusername.pythonanywhere.com/admin`
2. Login with: admin / admin123
3. **IMMEDIATELY change the admin password!**

### Content Setup
1. Delete sample subjects you don't need
2. Add your actual course subjects
